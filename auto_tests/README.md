Test mORMOt testing capabilities.

Most of the interesting code is in `tests/` subdirectory.

We test mostly `TSynTestCase` and `TSynTestsLogged`.

See also "Test Driven Development with mORMot 2 with Delphi and FPC", from https://blog.synopse.info/?post/2025/10/29/EKON-29-Slides , but admittedly this example doesn't dive into details: we just show how to use mormot.core.test in the simplest way. Start by doing it like this, and go from there :)
