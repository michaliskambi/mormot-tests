# Various small mORMot tests

These tests of [mORMot](https://github.com/synopse/mORMot2/) are independent from my other projects.

OK, with a small exception: the projects here _can_ be compiled and run with [Castle Game Engine build tool](https://castle-engine.io/build_tool), like this:

```
castle-engine compile-run
```

But you can also compile + run then from FPC, Lazarus, Delphi etc. -- the code doesn't depend on Castle Game Engine.
